        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Regular Cleaning</h2>
        <p>
          Dirt, leaves, and debris can accumulate on your deck and lead to mold and mildew growth. 
          We recommend sweeping your deck weekly and performing a thorough cleaning at least twice a year.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Inspect for Damage</h2>
        <p>
          Regularly check for loose boards, protruding nails, and signs of rot or insect damage. 
          Early detection of these issues can prevent more extensive damage down the line.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Apply Sealant or Stain</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your deck material, applying a water-repellent sealant or stain every 1-2 years 
          can protect it from moisture, UV rays, and general wear and tear.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Trim Nearby Vegetation</h2>
        <p>
          Overhanging branches and nearby shrubs can drop leaves and sap onto your deck, 
          contributing to moisture retention and potential damage.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Remove Snow Properly</h2>
        <p>
          In winter, use a plastic shovel rather than metal to remove snow from your deck to avoid scratching the surface. 
          Avoid using salt or ice-melting chemicals that can damage the wood.
        </p>
